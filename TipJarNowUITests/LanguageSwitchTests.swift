/// Regression coverage for CLAUDE.md lesson #34 — the in-app language picker
/// must re-localize content presented inside `.sheet` / `.fullScreenCover`,
/// not only the root view.
///
/// Canonical pattern copied from autoapp-days-until (DaysUntil shipped three
/// versions with a partial fix that only refreshed the root view; modal
/// surfaces stayed in the previous language until closed and re-opened). The
/// static lint `scripts/lint_modal_env.py` blocks the bug class at commit
/// time; this test confirms it at runtime.
///
/// Strategy: capture a piece of settings text before the language switch,
/// switch to a known-different locale, and assert the captured text is no
/// longer present in the same modal. We don't pin a specific Japanese
/// translation — that would couple the test to copy edits — only that the
/// English text disappears within the still-open modal, which is what the
/// bug allows to persist.
